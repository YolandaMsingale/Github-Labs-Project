## 🗂️ GitHub-Labs Project Board

I used a GitHub Project Board to organize and track my tasks throughout this capstone. It includes clearly labeled cards (To Do, In Progress, Done) and shows how I managed this assignment from start to finish.

## ⚙️ GitHub Actions Workflow

A `.yml` workflow file is configured inside the `.github/workflows/` directory.  
It automatically triggers on **push** and **pull requests**, and was tested successfully.

✅ Location: `.github/workflows/main.yml`  
✅ Trigger: `on: [push, pull_request]`
